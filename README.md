# me-concept

me helps you manage your self sovereign identity. Its goal is to enable identity recovery trough delegates, be permissionless and be completely open source. 

The app will support three main areas of functionality:

### 1. Wallet

Here are the things that hold economic value and are exchangable by the user. In the context of ethereum this can be ether, ERC20 tokens, and other assets.

### 2. Records

Records in this context are things that say something about you, but that hold no direct economic value and are not exchangable. E.g. your marks at school / your blood type / who are your parents.

### 3. Identity

By using the QR code scanner you can: 

* Log in to DAPPs / expose your identity
* Exchange value: image 1.1 is an example of the screen after scanning a voucher.
* Validate information (properties) image 1.2 is an example of the screen after scanning a validation request as in image 2.1.
